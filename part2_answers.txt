1. What does the `man` command do? Type in `man rm`. How do you scroll and get out?

**man command is used to display the user manual of any command that we can run on(запустить) на  the terminal**

**get out(выйти) - `Q`**

**scroll the screen while holding `fn +` ⇧**

1. Look at the `man` page for `ls`. What does the `-l` flag do? What does the `-a` flag do?

`ls - a` **will enlist the whole list of the current directory including the hidden files**

`ls - l` **- signifies the long list format (content permissions, number of links to the content, owner of the content, group owner of the content, size of the content in bytes, last modified date/time of the content, file or directory name)**

1. Type the following command to download and save the contents of google.com: `curl https://www.google.com > google.html`

`curl`**- client URL - is a command line tool that developers use to transfer data to and from a server.**

`code google.html` - open this file in Visual studio code

1. Use `less` to look at the contents of `google.html`.

`**less` is a command that displays file contents or command output one page at a time in your terminal
`less` is most useful for viewing the content of large files or the results of commands that produce many lines of output**

1. Look at the `man` page for less. Read the section on `/pattern`. Search for the text **hplogo** in the `google.html` file.

**Hold `option` and press the `arrow` keys left or right to move by word**

1. What is the difference between a terminal and a shell?

**The shell is the program which actually processes commands and returns output. Most shells also manage foreground and background processes, command history and command line editing. These features (and many more) are standard in bash, the most common shell in modern linux systems. (We are using `zsh`).**

**A terminal refers to a wrapper program which runs(запускает) a shell.** 

1. What is an absolute path? What is a relative path?

**A path is simply the way to reach a file or folder. When we specify a path starting from the root directory `/`, we call that an absolute path. For example, if I am currently in the `~` home directory and I would like to change directories into my Desktop folder, I can do that in two of the following ways:**

**1. `cd Desktop` - relative to where I am currently
2.`cd /Users/eschoppik/Desktop` - absolute, starting from the root (first `/`, then `Users`, then `eschoppik`, then `Desktop`)**

1. What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used.

Command-line programs often accept flags or options from users to customize the command's execution. Flags are **key-value pairs that are added after the command name while running the command**

1. What do the `r` and `f` flags do with the `rm` command?

`**rm -r [directory_name]` - remove a directory (and all files inside that directory)**

`**rm -f` - attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation, regardless of the file's permissions.**

`**rm -rf**`  - means that you recursively and forcibly remove a directory (and its contents) without prompting for confirmation.
